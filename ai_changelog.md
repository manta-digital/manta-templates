# AI Development Changelog

This file contains detailed technical information about major development milestones for AI context and project state understanding.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-08-30 - Major Architecture Refactoring

### Theme-Aware Gradient System Implementation
- **Complete GradientCard component overhaul** with dual control API
  - Range-based controls (0-100) for granular gradient positioning
  - Accent-to-accent controls (accent-7 to accent-10) for theme-aware color mapping
  - Dynamic theme switching with automatic gradient recomputation
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with migration examples

### Framework-Agnostic UI Architecture Migration
- **Extracted `@manta-templates/ui-core`** package from Next.js-specific implementation
  - Framework-agnostic component library supporting multiple React frameworks
  - Theme-aware design tokens with Radix Colors integration
  - Markdown-driven content system supporting rich content without hardcoding
- **Created `@manta-templates/ui-adapters-nextjs`** for Next.js integration layer
  - Next.js-specific optimizations and server component compatibility
  - Content loading and processing utilities
  - Framework adapter pattern for future expansion

### Monorepo Version Management System
- **Version sync script** (`scripts/version-sync.sh`) for coordinated package releases
  - Unified versioning across all packages (ui-core, ui-adapters, templates, landing)
  - Multi-level git tagging convention (main, packages, template-specific)
  - Interactive prompts with validation and confirmation
  - Support for both jq and sed-based JSON manipulation
- **Automated changelog updates** before tagging
- **Package synchronization** - All packages aligned to version 0.7.4 baseline

### Testing Framework Migration
- **Complete migration** from custom tsx/console.log format to standard Vitest
  - 45 comprehensive tests covering gradient logic, component rendering, and theme integration
  - React Testing Library integration for component testing
  - Visual regression tests for color cascade resolution
  - JSX compilation fixes in TypeScript test files
  - Standardized test structure with describe/test blocks

### Component Architecture Transformation
- **Migrated from hardcoded components** to flexible content system
  - Technology carousel now fully content-managed via markdown
  - Dynamic component loading based on content type
  - Eliminated hardcoded technology lists and feature descriptions
  - Centralized content management with type safety

### Git Repository Management
- **Cleaned up repository tags** and established new conventions
  - Removed temporary/backup tags (backup-pre-reset, reset-2025-08-15-before, working-state-before-header-refactor)
  - Implemented structured tagging for monorepo releases
  - Clear tagging strategy: v0.8.0 (main), v0.8.0-packages, v0.8.0-template-nextjs

### Technical Issue Resolutions
- **Client/server component boundaries**: Resolved React hooks usage in server components
  - Added 'use client' directive to GradientCard for proper hook usage
  - Fixed useEffect and theme context access in Next.js App Router
- **Theme integration issues**: Resolved color cascade and theme switching problems
  - Fixed gradient recomputation on theme changes
  - Ensured proper CSS variable mapping across theme variants
- **Package version synchronization**: Coordinated versioning across all monorepo packages

### Breaking Changes Implemented
- **GradientCard API migration**: Legacy `gradient` prop replaced with `from`/`to` accent-based system
  ```tsx
  // Before:
  <GradientCard gradient="teal">
  
  // After:
  <GradientCard from="accent-7" to="accent-10">
  ```
- **Package structure reorganization**: Components moved from template-specific locations to shared ui-core package
- **Test format standardization**: Custom test format replaced with standard Vitest/Jest patterns

### Development Workflow Enhancements
- **Cross-framework compatibility**: UI core package designed to work across React-based frameworks
- **Improved maintainability**: Clear dependency boundaries between packages
- **Standardized tooling**: Reduced friction in monorepo management
- **Enhanced documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc with migration guides and usage examples

### Key Technical Achievements
- **Dual gradient API design**: Successfully balances granular control with theme-aware simplicity
- **Content management flexibility**: Markdown-driven system supports rich content without hardcoding
- **Comprehensive testing coverage**: 45 tests ensure system reliability and theme integration
- **Successful framework abstraction**: UI components now work across different React frameworks
- **Effective monorepo coordination**: Version sync system enables coordinated releases

### Files and Components Modified
- **Core Components**:
  - `/packages/ui-core/src/components/cards/GradientCard.tsx` - Complete rewrite with dual API
  - `/templates/nextjs/src/app/examples/page.tsx` - Migrated to new gradient API
  - `/landing/src/app/page.tsx` - Simplified from customGradient to from/to API

- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - `/packages/ui-core/vitest.config.ts` - New Vitest configuration with JSX support
  - Multiple test files converted from custom format to standardized Vitest
  - 45 tests covering gradient logic, rendering, and theme integration

- **Package Configuration**:
  - All `package.json` files updated to version 0.7.4 for baseline synchronization
  - New dependencies added for testing framework
  - Peer dependencies properly configured for framework abstraction

- **Development Tooling**:
  - `/scripts/version-sync.sh` - Comprehensive version management script
  - Version synchronization across 4 packages (ui-core, ui-adapters, template, landing)

This represents approximately 20+ hours of focused development work across multiple sessions, involving complex architectural decisions, systematic refactoring, and comprehensive testing implementation.
