We are more concerned with creating detailed tasks than a strict Phase 3 / Phase 4 adherence. We will create our tasks in tasks.{section}.md.\n\nIf tasks.{section}.md already exists, you should be given a current subsection or phase of the {feature} document for which we will create tasks. Insert our tasks into the existing document, keeping subsections in numerical order.",
