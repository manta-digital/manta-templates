# Tasks: Restructured ai-project-guide Layout

## Context Summary

Converting ai-project-guide from git subtree integration to git submodule structure to:
- Separate framework guides (submodule) from user project documents (parent repo)
- Enable easy updates for both npm and non-npm projects
- Eliminate conflicts between framework updates and user work
- Simplify npm scripts by removing file copying dance

**Target Structure:**
```
project-documents/
├── ai-project-guide/    # Submodule (framework)
└── private/             # User work (parent repo)
```

## Task 1: Update npm Scripts

### 1.1 Update setup-guides Script
- [x] Modify `snippets/npm-scripts.ai-support.json.md` with new submodule-based scripts
- [x] Create `project-documents/private/` subdirectories: architecture, slices, tasks, features, reviews, analysis
- [x] Add git submodule at `project-documents/ai-project-guide`
- [x] Create `.gitkeep` in `project-documents/private/` to ensure directory is tracked
- [x] Test script creates correct structure in fresh project (tested with Python bootstrap)
- **Success:** ✅ Updated snippet shows proper setup-guides script for user projects

### 1.2 Simplify update-guides Script
- [x] Renamed `guides` script to `update-guides` in snippet
- [x] Updated to simple: `git submodule update --remote project-documents/ai-project-guide`
- [x] No need to preserve private/ (it's in parent repo, not submodule)
- [x] Test update works without touching user files (tested locally)
- **Success:** ✅ Script updates guides without affecting `project-documents/private/`

### 1.3 Review sync-guides Script
- [x] Evaluated sync-guides - not present in current snippet
- [x] Not needed with new submodule structure
- [x] Standard git submodule commands handle all sync needs
- **Success:** ✅ No sync-guides needed - obsolete with submodule approach

### 1.4 Create Bootstrap Scripts (Bonus)
- [x] Created `scripts/bootstrap.sh` for universal setup
- [x] Created `scripts/bootstrap.py` for Python-based setup
- [x] Both support one-command curl setup
- [x] Auto-initialize git repo if needed
- [x] Tested in fresh Python projects
- **Success:** ✅ Bootstrap scripts enable zero-dependency setup for any project type

## Task 2: Update Path References in Documentation

### 2.1 Search for Guide Path References
- [x] Run: `grep -r "project-guides/" --include="*.md"` and document findings
- [x] Run: `grep -r "tool-guides/" --include="*.md"` and document findings
- [x] Run: `grep -r "framework-guides/" --include="*.md"` and document findings
- [x] Create list of all files needing path updates (17 files identified)

- [x] Update `directory-structure.md` - updated to show ai-project-guide/ and private/ as siblings, removed research-crumbs
- **Success:** ✅ All core documentation references correct submodule paths

### 2.3 Update Guide References in project-guides/
- [x] Update `guide.ai-project.000-process.md` - updated structure diagram and all guide paths
- [x] Update `guide.ai-project.001-concept.md` - updated output path, fixed filename to 001-
- [x] Update `guide.ai-project.002-spec.md` - updated tool-guides path, fixed filename to 002-
- [x] Update `guide.ai-project.003-slice-planning.md` - already correct, uses private/ paths
- [x] Update `guide.ai-project.004-slice-design.md` - updated tool-guides and framework-guides paths
- [x] Update `guide.ai-project.006-task-expansion.md` - already correct, no guide references

### 2.4 Update Monorepo-Specific References
- [x] Review monorepo context initialization prompt
- [x] Update guide references to `ai-project-guide/project-guides/guide.ai-project.000-process`
- [x] Verify `project-artifacts/` pattern remains unchanged (confirmed - private/ maps correctly)

## Task 4: Consolidate and Update Setup Scripts

### 4.1 Analyze Existing Template Scripts
- [x] Review current `setup-guides.sh` from template(s) (found in scripts/monorepo-templates/)
- [x] Review current `update-guides.sh` from template(s) (found in scripts/monorepo-templates/)
- [x] Document capabilities and features of existing scripts
- [x] Identify differences between template versions (React template reviewed - no React-specific code)
- [x] Compare with bootstrap scripts already created
- [x] Created GitHub issue #5 for org private guides feature (deferred to future)
- [x] Resolved directory structure mismatch (finalized: analysis, architecture, features, project-guides, reviews, slices, tasks)
- [x] Confirmed git submodule approach is superior to rsync approach
- [x] Confirmed no special monorepo handling needed (same paths work everywhere)
- **Success:** ✅ Complete understanding of current script capabilities and submodule benefits

### 4.2 Evaluate Consolidation Feasibility
- [x] Determine if scripts can be unified and moved to ai-project-guide/scripts/
- [x] Identify any template-specific logic that must remain separate (none - framework-agnostic)
- [x] Assess chicken-and-egg problem: how do fresh templates get the scripts initially?
- [x] Determine script distribution mechanism from monorepo to templates (manual copy stubs)
- [x] Document pros/cons of consolidation vs keeping distributed
- [x] **Decision:** Option B - Minimal stub scripts in templates, full scripts in ai-project-guide
- **Success:** ✅ Clear decision on script consolidation strategy

### 4.3 Update Scripts for New Directory Structure
- [x] Update script paths to use `project-documents/ai-project-guide/` structure (already done in Task 1)
- [x] Update `private/` subdirectory creation (analysis, architecture, features, project-guides, reviews, slices, tasks)
- [x] Verify scripts create `.gitkeep` in private/ directory (confirmed)
- [x] Update any hardcoded paths or assumptions about structure (all paths updated)
- [x] Ensure scripts handle both fresh install and already-installed cases (idempotent checks in place)
- **Success:** ✅ Scripts work correctly with new submodule structure

### 4.4 Update File Naming Patterns
- [x] Review scripts for any filename pattern assumptions (none found - scripts only create directories)
- [x] Update to use `nnn-` index patterns where applicable (N/A - scripts don't create indexed files)
- [x] Ensure consistency with `file-naming-conventions.md` (verified - no conflicts)
- [x] Update any date format patterns (MMDD vs YYYYMMDD) (N/A - scripts don't use dates)
- **Success:** ✅ Scripts use current naming conventions (no file creation, only directories)

### 4.5 Resolve Initial Bootstrap Problem
- [x] Document how templates initially get setup scripts (stub scripts copied to templates)
- [x] Determine if scripts are copied from ai-project-guide/scripts during template creation (yes - manual copy of stubs)
- [x] Design solution for fresh template clones (3-line stub downloads bootstrap.sh from GitHub)
- [x] Update npm scripts in snippet to handle bootstrap case (already updated in Task 1)
- [x] Created template-stubs/ directory with setup-guides.sh and update-guides.sh
- [x] Created README.md documentation for template maintainers
- [ ] Test bootstrap flow: fresh template → pnpm setup-guides → working state (requires template testing)
- **Success:** ✅ Clear, working bootstrap mechanism documented (testing deferred to Task 5)

### 4.6 Implementation and Testing
- [x] Move/create consolidated scripts in ai-project-guide/scripts/ (bootstrap.sh, bootstrap.py, setup-project-guides.py already exist)
- [x] Update `snippets/npm-scripts.ai-support.json.md` with final script calls (done in Task 1)
- [x] Create any necessary wrapper or bootstrap logic (template-stubs created)
- [x] Document script distribution process for monorepo (README.md in template-stubs/)
- [ ] Test scripts in isolation (outside of npm) (deferred to Task 5)
- [ ] Test npm wrapper scripts (deferred to Task 5)
- [ ] **TODO:** Copy template stubs to monorepo templates before completion
- **Success:** ✅ Scripts consolidated and documented (testing deferred to Task 5)
