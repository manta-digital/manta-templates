# Getting Started with Next.js

Welcome to the world of Next.js! This comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamentals of building modern React applications with Next.js.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a complete solution for building production-ready web applications with features like:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- Automatic code splitting
- Built-in optimizations

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js application and start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Features

### File-based Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Simply create files in the `pages` directory (or `app` directory with App Router), and they automatically become routes.

### Built-in CSS Support

Next.js supports CSS Modules, Styled JSX, and popular CSS-in-JS libraries out of the box.

### Image Optimization

The Next.js `Image` component provides automatic image optimization, lazy loading, and responsive images.

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework that makes it easy to build fast, scalable React applications. With its built-in optimizations and developer-friendly features, it's an excellent choice for your next project.
