# React Best Practices for 2024

React continues to evolve, and so do the best practices for building React applications. Here are the essential patterns and practices you should follow in 2024.

## Component Design

### Use Functional Components

Functional components with hooks are now the standard. They're more concise and easier to test.

```jsx
// Good
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      {isLoading && <Spinner />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Keep Components Small and Focused

Each component should have a single responsibility. If a component is doing too much, break it down.

## State Management

### Use useState for Local State

For component-level state, `useState` is perfect:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Consider useReducer for Complex State

When state logic becomes complex, `useReducer` provides better organization:

```jsx
function TodoList() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(todoReducer, initialState);
  
  return (
    <div>
      {state.todos.map(todo => (
        <TodoItem 
          key={todo.id} 
          todo={todo} 
          onToggle={() => dispatch({ type: 'TOGGLE', id: todo.id })}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Performance

### Use React.memo Judiciously

Only use `React.memo` when you have a performance problem:

```jsx
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(function ExpensiveComponent({ data }) {
  // Expensive rendering logic
  return <div>{data.complexCalculation}</div>;
});
```

### Optimize with useMemo and useCallback

Use these hooks to prevent unnecessary recalculations:

```jsx
function UserList({ users, filter }) {
  const filteredUsers = useMemo(() => 
    users.filter(user => user.name.includes(filter)), 
    [users, filter]
  );
  
  const handleUserClick = useCallback((userId) => {
    // Handle click
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div>
      {filteredUsers.map(user => (
        <UserItem key={user.id} user={user} onClick={handleUserClick} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you write more maintainable, performant, and scalable React applications. Remember to always measure performance before optimizing, and keep your components simple and focused.
