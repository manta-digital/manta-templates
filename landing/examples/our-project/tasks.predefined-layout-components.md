# Phase 4 â€“ Task Expansion: Predefined Layout Components

The following subtasks expand the Detailed Task Breakdown for the Predefined Layout Components section. Each subtask is atomic and includes acceptance criteria.

## Predefined Layout Components
### Portfolio Dashboard Layout

- [x] Design grid-as-data structure for dashboard

  - Acceptance: Structure supports at least 2 breakpoint variants and arbitrary row/col spans

- [x] Implement PortfolioDashboardLayout component
  - File: `src/components/PortfolioDashboardLayout.tsx`
  - Accepts grid data prop and renders colored rectangles as placeholders
  - Acceptance: Renders a grid matching the provided structure at all breakpoints

- [x] Example/test page for PortfolioDashboardLayout
  - File: `src/app/examples/portfolio/page.tsx`
  - Demonstrates the dashboard layout with placeholder cards
  - Acceptance: Visual confirmation of correct layout at each breakpoint

- [x] Documentation
  - Add usage and grid-data structure docs to project documentation
  - Acceptance: Docs explain how to use and extend grid-as-data for new layouts
