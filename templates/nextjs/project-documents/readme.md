# Manta Knowledge & Guide Repository

Welcome!  
This repo is the single source of truth for every guide, playbook, and reference that powers our projects and agentic workflows. If you‚Äôre a human contributor, start here. If you‚Äôre an AI agent, parse the folder map below to find exactly what you need‚Äîno guessing required.

## üîë What lives where?

| Folder                  | Look here when you need‚Ä¶                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`project-guides/`**   | Process & methodology docs that apply to _every_ project (e.g., guide.ai-project.process, guide.ai-project.spec, Code Rules). |
| **`framework-guides/`** | App-level runtimes or platforms that own the entire build/runtime cycle (Next.js, Astro, Flutter, Qt‚Ä¶).                       |
| **`tool-guides/`**      | Importable libraries or UI kits you slot _into_ an app (SciChart, Three.js, Tailwind‚Ä¶).                                       |
| **`api-guides/`**       | External data or service endpoints accessed over HTTP/gRPC (USGS Water Services, ArcGIS, Alpha Vantage‚Ä¶).                     |
| **`domain-guides/`**    | Cross-cutting subject knowledge useful across many projects (game-development, hydrology, financial-visualisation‚Ä¶).          |
| **`snippets/`**         | Language-agnostic code fragments and quick copy-paste helpers.                                                                |

## üß≠ Zero-ambiguity decision matrix

1. Is it a **process** document? ‚Üí `project-guides/`
2. Does it **own the whole app lifecycle**? ‚Üí `framework-guides/`
3. Is it an **external network API**? ‚Üí `api-guides/`
4. Is it **imported as a library** inside another app? ‚Üí `tool-guides/`
5. Is it broad **subject matter** knowledge? ‚Üí `domain-guides/`

Anything that doesn‚Äôt match gets flagged for discussion before filing.

## üìê Naming & formatting conventions

All file and folder names follow our kebab-case pattern and document-type prefixes outlined in [`file-naming-conventions.md`](project-documents/file-naming-conventions.md). file-naming-conventions.md](file-service://file-9aqEMStvihP9s5DfmT7yFh)  
Please review that doc before adding or renaming files.

## üöÄ Quick start for humans & AIs

1. **Read this README** (you‚Äôre here!).
2. **Jump to the folder** that matches the decision matrix above.
3. **Add YAML front-matter** (`layer: framework|tool|api|domain|process`) to any new guide so agents can auto-classify even if it‚Äôs misplaced.

## ü§ù Contributing

- Keep documents concise; link out rather than duplicate content.
- Cite sources inline when pulling in external material.
- Follow the ‚Äúone-path rule‚Äù: each document should live in exactly one canonical folder.
- For substantial restructures, update `directory-structure.md` first, then this README.

Thanks for helping maintain a knowledge base that humans and AI agents can navigate with zero friction! Happy building.
