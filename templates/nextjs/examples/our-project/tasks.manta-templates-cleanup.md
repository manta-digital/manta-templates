# Manta Templates Cleanup - Task Breakdown

## Section 1: Card System Migration (V1 → V2)

### Overview
Migrate template from V1 cards to V2 cards for consistency with landing page and better ShadCN integration. V2 cards use ShadCN foundation with Card, CardHeader, CardContent components, providing better accessibility via Radix UI primitives and enhanced TypeScript interfaces.

### Current State
- **Template**: Uses V1 cards (BlogCard, BlogCardWide, BlogCardImage, BaseCard)
- **Landing Page**: Uses V2 cards (BlogCardV2, BlogCardWideV2, BlogCardImageV2, BaseCardV2)
- **Dev Page**: Shows side-by-side comparison at `/dev/cards`

### Tasks

- [x] **Assess landing workspace capacity**
  - Verify that corresponding routes/components do not already exist in `landing/` workspace  
  - Identify naming collisions or required renames  
  - Success: Clear migration map from template → landing gallery

#### 2.2 Migrate Test Pages to Landing Gallery
- [x] **Create gallery routes in landing workspace**
  - Add pages under `landing/src/app/gallery/*` mirroring original routes (`cards`, `composition`, `variants`, `radix-colors`)  
  - Ensure routing uses App Router conventions (Next 15)  
  - Success: Landing dev server displays migrated pages without errors

- [x] **Transfer page source & assets**
  - Copy TSX/MDX, images, and local helpers; update import paths to landing equivalents  
  - Replace Tailwind v3 classes with v4 utilities if encountered  
  - Success: Pages compile with Tailwind 4 & Radix custom palettes intact

#### 2.3 Reorganize Dev-Only Components
- [ ] **Move reusable dev components to `/components/dev/`**
  - Within template, create `src/components/dev/` and move test utilities (e.g., `CardVariantTest`, `RadixColorTest`)  
  - Export via `components/dev/index.ts` for easy tree-shaking  
  - Success: No dev component lives in production bundles (verified via `next build --profile`)

- [x] **Update imports after move**
  - Refactor test pages (now in landing) to import from `landing/components/dev`  
  - Template code must not import from `components/dev`  
  - Success: `grep -R "from .*components/dev" templates/nextjs/src` returns 0 results

#### 2.4 Clean Template Routes & Navigation
- [x] **Remove test routes from template**
  - Delete `/src/app/test*`, `/src/app/dev/cards`, and related navigation links  
  - Update any leftover links in header/footer components  
  - Success: Production template build contains no test routes (checked via `.next/routes-manifest.json`)

#### 2.5 Landing Gallery Link Card
- [x] **2.5.1 Analyze Existing Grid Layout**
  - Review the Examples section grid implementation in `landing/src/app/page.tsx` (done)
  - Determine how grid rows and columns are structured (e.g., CSS grid, Bento grid, etc.) (done)
  - Identify how to insert a new row at the top without breaking layout (done)

- [x] **2.5.2 Define Gallery Card Requirements**
  - Card should visually match other example cards in the grid
  - Card must always span all columns (full-width, first row)
  - Card should function as a link to the gallery page (`/gallery` or equivalent)
  - Card should have a clear label (e.g., “Explore Card Gallery”)
  - Card should be accessible (keyboard, screen reader)

- [x] **2.5.3 Implement Full-Width Gallery Card**
  - Insert a new grid row (row 0) with a single cell spanning all columns (done)
  - Add the gallery card with correct styling and link behavior (done)
  - Ensure card is responsive and maintains grid integrity across breakpoints (done)

- [x] **2.5.5 Test and Validate**
  - Verify card appears as the first row, full width, on all screen sizes
  - Confirm link navigates to gallery page
  - Check accessibility and keyboard navigation
  - Ensure no regressions in grid layout or other cards

#### 2.6 Testing & Validation
- [x] **Functional tests**

- ✅ Landing gallery includes all migrated demos with enhanced UI
- ✅ All dev utilities live under `/components/dev` or landing workspace only
- ✅ Tailwind 4 and Radix custom palettes work across all gallery pages
- ✅ No build errors, lint warnings, or broken links

### Benefits Achieved
- **Clean Starter**: Production template is free of dev clutter
- **Rich Gallery**: Landing demonstrates full capabilities without polluting core template
- **Better DX**: Developers still have access to utilities in an organized location
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation simplifies future updates and CLI automation

### 97: Bugs
- [ ] Some objects are not maintaining proper height, for example the documentation inner cards in the landing page.
- [ ] Some focus rectangles do not match their card shape (blog, gallery).
- [x] Blog card is skipped in tab layout -- cannot tab to blog card.
- [x] in light mode, we should use Text White or similar, not dark text, for gradient cards

### 98: Maintenance Items
- [x] interactive card in variant test needs transition

### 99: Future Enhancements
- [ ] carousel sizing needs adjustment as it cuts off the elevated card shadow
- [ ] update and enhance gallery card (placeholder in first grid row)
- [x] default card variant now displays correct border and shadow consistently across test pages.

## Section 3: Example Pages Curation

### Overview
Curate example pages in the template to keep only essential demos, while migrating advanced and experimental examples to the landing page. Ensure all examples use updated (V2) cards, maintain a clean and professional appearance, and provide clear documentation and navigation.

### Tasks

  - Keep `/examples/blog`, `/examples/portfolio`, and `/examples/bentogrid` in the template
  - Remove or migrate `/examples/masonrygrid`, `/examples/gridlayout`, and any other advanced/experimental examples
  - Success: Only essential examples remain in the template
  - **Findings**: Removed masonrygrid and gridlayout (preserved in landing). Blog, bentogrid, portfolio remain.

- [x] **Update all essential examples to use V2 cards**
  - Refactor imports and usage to ensure BlogCard, BlogCardWide, BlogCardImage, and BaseCard are V2
  - Test rendering and styling for each essential example
  - Success: All essential examples use V2 cards and render correctly
  - **Findings**: Already completed during V2 cleanup. All examples use BaseCard imports correctly.

#### 3.3 Migration of Advanced Examples

  - Update import paths and dependencies as needed for landing environment
  - Test migrated pages in landing dev server
  - Success: Advanced examples function correctly in landing page

  - **Findings**: Navigation already updated in 3.3.1. Header/footer contain no links to removed examples.

- [x] **Add references to landing page for advanced examples**
  - In template documentation, guide users to landing page HOWEVER, just send them to https://templates.manta.digital,
    as that is where we actually deploy the landing page.  A user using the nextjs template to create an app starter will not (and should not) need to know about manta-templates/landing (the landing page folder in the monorepo).
  - If we have additional monorepo documentation, *that* is the place to explain in context of templates/nextjs vs   
    landing/, as these users are actually working in the monorepo.
  - Success: Users are guided to the landing page for more examples
  - **Findings**: README already contained good references to templates.manta.digital. Enhanced wording for clarity.

- [x] **Update documentation to reflect curated examples**
  - Revise any docs listing example pages to match the new set
  - Remove references to deleted/migrated examples
  - Ensure code samples use V2 cards and current examples
  - Success: Documentation is accurate and up-to-date

#### 3.5 Testing & Validation
- [x] **Test all preserved example pages**
  - Verify `/examples/blog`, `/examples/portfolio`, and `/examples/bentogrid` render correctly and use V2 cards
  - Check for responsive design, accessibility, and theme switching

- [x] **Test landing page advanced examples**
  - Verify migrated examples render and function in the landing workspace
  - Check for styling, responsiveness, and correct imports
  - Success: Advanced examples are fully functional in landing
  - **Findings**: Advanced examples confirmed preserved in landing/src/app/examples/ during Section 3.3

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Only essential examples remain in the template (blog, portfolio, bentogrid)
- ✅ All template examples use V2 cards exclusively
- ✅ Advanced/experimental examples are migrated to the landing page and work correctly
- ✅ Navigation and documentation are updated and accurate
- ✅ No broken links or references to removed examples
