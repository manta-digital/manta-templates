# Code Review: about/page.tsx

## Critical Issues
No critical issues identified.

## Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] **Hard-coded Elements**: All content including descriptions, features, and URLs are hard-coded (lines 16-22, 26-28, 47-65)
- [ ] **Configuration**: External URL and template details should be configurable

## Best Practices & Patterns
- [ ] **Security**: External link properly secured with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- [ ] **React Patterns**: Clean functional component structure
- [ ] **TypeScript**: Proper component typing

## Accessibility & UX
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Decorative list dots need proper ARIA handling (lines 47-65)
- [ ] **Semantic HTML**: Feature list could benefit from better semantic structure

## Testing & Documentation
- [ ] **SEO**: Missing metadata export for page title and description

## Summary
Well-structured about page with good security practices. Main improvements needed in content configurability and SEO metadata. Priority level: P1-P3 improvements, solid foundation overall.
