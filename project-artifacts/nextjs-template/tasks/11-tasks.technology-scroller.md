## Context Summary
- Working on technology-scroller slice to fix failed migration attempts
- ui-core can depend on: react, shadcn, tailwind, radix.  it cannot depend on: nextjs.  things like SemanticColors.css *should* be in ui-core.  do not get too carried away with the 'framework agnostic' idea.
- Current project state: TechnologyScroller works in templates/nextjs but completely breaks when moved to ui-core
- Root cause: CSS masking for colored icons fails in ui-core build pipeline, asset path resolution issues
- Solution approach: Keep in ui-core with proper dependency injection, create Next.js adapter
- What this slice delivers: Working TechnologyScroller in ui-core with Next.js adapter for image optimization
- Next planned slice: Slice 10 (Template Migration) or Slice 12 (Testing Infrastructure)

## Phase 1: Fix ui-core Component

### Task 1.1: Analyze Current Working Implementation
**Scope**: Document exactly how TechnologyScroller works in templates/nextjs
**Instructions**:
- Read and analyze `/templates/nextjs/src/components/ui/TechnologyScroller.tsx`
- Document all CSS dependencies from `/templates/nextjs/src/app/globals.css`
- List all SVG assets in `/templates/nextjs/public/assets/icons/tech/`
- Create detailed documentation of current CSS masking implementation and write this to a file (lld, slice design, somewhere findable)
- Document color mapping for light/dark themes.  Note that we will need SemanticColors.css in ui-core, if it is not already.  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Complete component analysis documented ✅ COMPLETED: Analysis completed, working implementation identified
- [x] All CSS dependencies identified ✅ COMPLETED: Animation CSS and styling dependencies documented  
- [x] Asset inventory completed ✅ COMPLETED: SVG assets and icon requirements catalogued
- [x] CSS masking technique fully understood ✅ COMPLETED: Masking approach analyzed and understood
- [x] Color handling strategy documented ✅ COMPLETED: Light/dark theme color handling documented

### Task 1.2: Move Animation CSS to ui-core
**Scope**: Move TechnologyScroller animation classes from templates/nextjs to ui-core
**Instructions**:
- Copy animation CSS from `/templates/nextjs/src/app/globals.css` to ui-core CSS files
- Add to `/packages/ui-core/src/styles/` (find appropriate file or create technology-scroller.css)
- Include: `@keyframes scroll`, `.animate-scroll-fast`, `.animate-scroll-normal`, `.animate-scroll-slow`, `.animate-reverse`
- Update ui-core's main CSS export to include these animations
- Update TechnologyScroller component to use the CSS classes directly
- Remove animation CSS from templates/nextjs globals.css

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Animation CSS moved to ui-core package ✅ COMPLETED: Animation CSS properly integrated in ui-core
- [x] ui-core exports include animation styles ✅ COMPLETED: Animation styles exported and available
- [x] TechnologyScroller uses CSS classes (not inline styles) ✅ COMPLETED: Component uses CSS classes for animations
- [x] Animation performance matches original exactly ✅ COMPLETED: Fixed animation issues, smooth scrolling performance achieved
- [x] No duplicate CSS between packages ✅ COMPLETED: CSS properly organized without duplication

### Task 1.3: Implement Robust Icon Rendering
**Scope**: Create fallback icon rendering that works without CSS masking
**Instructions**:
- Analyze why CSS masking fails in ui-core environment.  Remainder depends on results of this analysis.
-- STOP HERE --

- Implement SVG filter-based color approach as primary fallback
- Keep CSS masking as secondary option with proper error handling
- Add support for `iconBasePath` prop for flexible asset locations
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all icon rendering paths
- Test with sample icons from templates/nextjs

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// SVG filter approach for colors
const getColorFilter = (color: string) => {
  // Convert hex color to CSS filter values
  // Implementation should handle common icon colors
};

// Rendering priority:
// 1. CSS masking (if working)
// 2. SVG filters for colors
// 3. Plain image with invert for dark mode
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Icons display correctly with color when specified
- [ ] Fallback rendering works when CSS masking fails
- [ ] Dark mode color handling works properly
- [ ] iconBasePath prop allows flexible asset locations
- [ ] TypeScript types are complete and accurate

### Task 1.4: Add Framework Image Component Injection
**Scope**: Enable dependency injection for framework-specific image optimization
**Instructions**:
- Add `ImageComponent` prop to TechnologyScrollerProps interface
- Default to standard HTML `img` element when no component provided
- Handle both string ('img') and component types properly
- Pass through appropriate props (src, alt, width, height, className)
- Ensure component works with Next.js Image when injected
- Test with both default img and Next.js Image component

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] ImageComponent prop properly typed and functional
- [ ] Defaults to HTML img element when not provided
- [ ] Next.js Image component works when injected
- [ ] Props are passed through correctly to image component
- [ ] No runtime errors with different image component types

## Phase 2: Create Next.js Adapter

### Task 2.1: Create Next.js TechnologyScroller Adapter
**Scope**: Build thin wrapper that injects Next.js Image component
**Instructions**:
- Create `/packages/ui-adapters/nextjs/src/components/TechnologyScroller.tsx`
- Import core TechnologyScroller from ui-core
- Import Next.js Image component
- Create wrapper component that passes Image as ImageComponent prop
- Re-export with proper TypeScript types
- Add JSDoc documentation explaining adapter purpose

**Implementation**:
```typescript
import { TechnologyScroller as CoreScroller } from '@manta-templates/ui-core';
import Image from 'next/image';
import type { TechnologyScrollerProps } from '@manta-templates/ui-core';

export const TechnologyScroller = (props: Omit<TechnologyScrollerProps, 'ImageComponent'>) => (
  <CoreScroller {...props} ImageComponent={Image} />
);
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Adapter component properly imports core component
- [ ] Next.js Image component correctly injected
- [ ] TypeScript types properly exported
- [ ] JSDoc documentation added
- [ ] Component compiles without errors

### Task 2.2: Configure Package Exports
**Scope**: Set up proper module exports for the adapter
**Instructions**:
- Update `/packages/ui-adapters/nextjs/package.json` exports field
- Update `/packages/ui-adapters/nextjs/src/index.ts` barrel export to include TechnologyScroller
- Export TechnologyScroller component with proper typing
- Add build verification to ensure exports work
- Test import from external package

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Package exports properly configured

- Change from local component to ui-adapters/nextjs
- Verify all props are passed correctly
- Update any other files importing TechnologyScroller
- Remove unused local TechnologyScroller component

**Import Change**:
```typescript
// Before
import { TechnologyScroller } from '@/components/ui/TechnologyScroller';

// After  
import { TechnologyScroller } from '@manta-templates/ui-adapters-nextjs';
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Template uses adapter instead of local component
