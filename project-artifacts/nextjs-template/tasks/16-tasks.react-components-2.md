# Tasks: React Components (Standard HTML Elements)

## Context Summary

Implementing standard React support for ui-core components by creating templates/react as validation and adding framework-agnostic video components. Current analysis shows that 95% of ui-core components already work in standard React environments through graceful HTML element defaults (img, a). Only video functionality requires new StandardBackgroundVideo and StandardVideoPlayer components.

**Development Approach**: Validate-first strategy by creating React template to prove existing functionality, then enhance with missing video components.

**Key Requirements**:
- Create templates/react using Vite + React to validate component compatibility
- Build StandardBackgroundVideo component for framework-agnostic video support  
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing Next.js injection patterns
- Demonstrate full ui-core functionality in standard React environments
