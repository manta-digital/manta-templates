# Tasks: Theme-Aware Gradients (Slice 14)

## Context Summary

This slice enhances the GradientCard component to create theme-aware gradients that adapt to current theme's background and accent colors. The implementation replaces confusing named presets (teal, blue, purple, etc.) with a clean dual-control system:

1. **Simple Range-Based**: Background → accent gradients controlled by 0-100 range
2. **Advanced Accent-to-Accent**: Direct accent level specification for precise control

The migration preserves exact visual appearance while providing cleaner APIs and eliminating duplicate gradient definitions.
