## Phase 2 Final: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

### Create Test Suite for Next.js Integration
- [x] Use existing comprehensive test page for all extracted components
  - [x] Use templates/nextjs/src/app/test-extracted/page.tsx
  - [x] Ensure ALL extracted cards are included with Next.js Image and Link injection
  - [x] Include edge cases, different props, responsive behavior
  - [x] Test dark/light mode compatibility for all cards
  - [x] Test animations, videos, 3D rendering where applicable
  - [x] Document visual regression testing approach

- [ ] Create unit/integration tests (high priority for accuracy)
  - [ ] Set up testing infrastructure in ui-core package
  - [ ] Create tests for each component with mocked Image/Link components
  - [ ] Test dependency injection patterns work correctly
  - [ ] Test component props and interfaces
  - [ ] Test responsive behavior programmatically
  - [ ] Success: Comprehensive test coverage prevents regressions

- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
  - [ ] Test bundle size impact of extracted components
  - [ ] Verify no performance degradation from dependency injection
  - [ ] Test lazy loading and code splitting compatibility
  - [ ] Success: Performance maintained or improved over originals
