# Code Review: PortfolioGrid.tsx

## Critical Issues
No critical issues identified.

## Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] **Hard-coded Elements**: Grid configuration and card styles are hard-coded (lines 8-26, 28-35, 65-69)
- [ ] **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded gap and row height values (lines 37-38, 48-49)
- [ ] **Placeholder Content**: Card content is placeholder text making component unusable for real portfolios

## Best Practices & Patterns
- [ ] **React Patterns**: Good use of hooks and conditional rendering
- [ ] **TypeScript**: Proper interface definitions and typing
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Excellent responsive grid configuration

## Accessibility & UX
- [ ] **Performance**: Map function creates new elements on every render (lines 61-69)
- [ ] **Component Structure**: Large conditional rendering could be simplified

## Testing & Documentation
- [ ] **Documentation**: Good interface documentation with JSDoc comments

## Summary
Well-architected portfolio grid with excellent responsive design. Main issues are hard-coded content and configuration making it unusable for real portfolios. Priority level: P1-P3 improvements, excellent responsive foundation.
