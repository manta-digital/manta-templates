# Code Review: blog/page.tsx (examples)

## Critical Issues
No critical issues identified.

## Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] **Hard-coded Elements**: All card content and colors are hard-coded test data (lines 6-14, 17-71)
- [ ] **Misleading Naming**: Component name doesn't reflect actual purpose as layout test (line 16)
- [ ] **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded color array and grid configuration values

## Best Practices & Patterns
- [ ] **React Patterns**: Good use of layout components and responsive design
- [ ] **Grid System**: Effective demonstration of BentoLayout capabilities

## Accessibility & UX
- [ ] **Content Structure**: Test content lacks semantic meaning for real usage

## Testing & Documentation
- [ ] **SEO**: Missing metadata export for example page
- [ ] **Purpose**: Component purpose unclear from naming

## Summary
Functional layout test page with good grid demonstrations. Main issues are hard-coded test data and misleading naming. Priority level: P1-P3 improvements, good for testing but needs refactoring for production use.
