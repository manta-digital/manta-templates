# Code Review: BentoGrid.tsx

## Critical Issues
No critical issues identified.

## Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] **Hard-coded Elements**: All text content is hard-coded (lines 25-46)
- [ ] **Invalid CSS Classes**: `bg-linear-to-br` and `bg-linear-to-tr` are invalid Tailwind classes (lines 17, 20, 44, 47)
- [ ] **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded gap and row height values (lines 12-13)

## Best Practices & Patterns
- [ ] **React Patterns**: Good use of conditional rendering and props
- [ ] **TypeScript**: Proper interface definition and typing
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Good responsive grid implementation

## Accessibility & UX
- [ ] **Component Structure**: Large conditional rendering could be split for better maintainability

## Testing & Documentation
- [ ] **Documentation**: Component purpose is clear from usage

## Summary
Functional bento grid component with good responsive design. Main issues are invalid CSS classes and hard-coded content. Priority level: P1-P3 improvements, solid grid system foundation.
