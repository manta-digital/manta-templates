# Code Review Tasks: themecontext.tsx

## P2: Best Practices
- [x] **Task: Add error handling for localStorage operations** ✅ OBSOLETE
  - Lines 35, 47: Add proper error handling for localStorage failures ✅ REMOVED: Component deleted
  - Handle cases where localStorage is not available ✅ REMOVED: Using ui-core ThemeProvider instead
  - Add fallback behavior for storage errors ✅ REMOVED: Duplicate of ui-core functionality
  - **Success:** ThemeContext removed - using ui-core ThemeProvider with proper error handling

## P3: Enhancements  
- [x] **Task: Add system theme detection** ✅ OBSOLETE
  - Add prefers-color-scheme media query detection ✅ REMOVED: ui-core ThemeProvider handles this
  - Automatically detect user's system theme preference ✅ REMOVED: Built into ui-core
  - Allow manual override of system preference ✅ REMOVED: ui-core provides this functionality
  - **Success:** ThemeContext removed - duplicate functionality now handled by ui-core ThemeProvider

## Component Status
**COMPONENT REMOVED**: templates/nextjs/src/context/themecontext.tsx has been deleted as it duplicated functionality provided by ui-core ThemeProvider. Template now uses ui-core theming system exclusively.
