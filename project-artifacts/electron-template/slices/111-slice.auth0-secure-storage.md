# Slice 111: Auth0 Secure Token Storage

## Overview
Placeholder - Design to be created after slice 110 is implemented.

## Scope
- electron-store integration for persistent storage
- safeStorage encryption (Keychain/DPAPI/kwallet)
- Encryption availability checking
- Graceful fallback with warnings when encryption unavailable
- Token persistence across app restarts

## Success Criteria
- Tokens securely encrypted and persisted
- Works cross-platform with appropriate OS-level encryption
- Graceful degradation on systems without encryption support
