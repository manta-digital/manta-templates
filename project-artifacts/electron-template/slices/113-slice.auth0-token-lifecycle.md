# Slice 113: Auth0 Token Lifecycle Management

## Overview
Placeholder - Design to be created after slice 112 is implemented.

## Scope
- Reactive token refresh (on 401 errors)
- Logout flow (clear tokens + Auth0 session)
- Basic token expiry handling
- Simple offline support (token validity check on app launch)
- Error recovery for common auth failures

## Success Criteria
- Complete auth lifecycle works (login → use → refresh → logout)
- Token refresh automatic and transparent to user
- Logout properly clears all auth state
- App handles expired tokens gracefully
