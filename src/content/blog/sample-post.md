This is the main content of the sample blog post.
It can include various markdown elements like headings, lists, and links.

## Heading Level 2

This is a paragraph under a level 2 heading. It contains some **bold text** and some *italic text*.

### Heading Level 3

Here's an unordered list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 2.1
  - Sub-item 2.2
- Item 3

And an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

> This is a blockquote. It should stand out from the rest of the text.

Finally, a code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet('World');
```

And an inline `code` example.
