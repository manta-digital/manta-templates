# Manta Knowledge & Guide Repository

Welcome!  
This repo is the single source of truth for every guide, playbook, and reference that powers our projects and agentic workflows.  If you‚Äôre a human contributor, start here. If you‚Äôre an AI agent, parse the folder map below to find exactly what you need‚Äîno guessing required.

## üîë What lives where?

| Folder | Look here when you need‚Ä¶                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`project-guides/`** | Process & methodology docs that apply to *every* project (e.g., guide.ai-project.process, guide.ai-project.spec, Code Rules). |
| **`framework-guides/`** | App-level runtimes or platforms that own the entire build/runtime cycle (Next.js, Astro, Flutter, Qt‚Ä¶).                       |
| **`tool-guides/`** | Importable libraries or UI kits you slot *into* an app (SciChart, Three.js, Tailwind‚Ä¶).                                       |
| **`api-guides/`** | External data or service endpoints accessed over HTTP/gRPC (USGS Water Services, ArcGIS, Alpha Vantage‚Ä¶).                     |
| **`domain-guides/`** | Cross-cutting subject knowledge useful across many projects (game-development, hydrology, financial-visualisation‚Ä¶).          |
| **`snippets/`** | Language-agnostic code fragments and quick copy-paste helpers.                                                                |

## üß≠ Zero-ambiguity decision matrix

1. Is it a **process** document? ‚Üí `project-guides/`  
2. Does it **own the whole app lifecycle**? ‚Üí `framework-guides/`  
3. Is it an **external network API**? ‚Üí `api-guides/`  
4. Is it **imported as a library** inside another app? ‚Üí `tool-guides/`  
5. Is it broad **subject matter** knowledge? ‚Üí `domain-guides/`  

Anything that doesn‚Äôt match gets flagged for discussion before filing.

---
## üìê Naming & formatting conventions

All file and folder names follow our kebab-case pattern and document-type prefixes outlined in [`file-naming-conventions.md`](project-documents/file-naming-conventions.md). file-naming-conventions.md](file-service://file-9aqEMStvihP9s5DfmT7yFh)  
Please review that doc before adding or renaming files.

---
## üöÄ Quick start for humans & AIs

1. **Read this README** (you‚Äôre here!).  
2. **Jump to the folder** that matches the decision matrix above.  
3. **Add YAML front-matter** (`layer: framework|tool|api|domain|process`) to any new guide so agents can auto-classify even if it‚Äôs misplaced.

## üì¶ Adding Guides to Existing Projects

Have an existing project that's getting complex? AIs starting to struggle with organization? These guides can help! Here are two ways to add them to any existing repository:

### Option 1: Simple Clone (Recommended)
```bash
# In your existing project root
mkdir project-documents
cd project-documents
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none https://github.com/ecorkran/ai-project-guide.git .
```
This gives you all guides in read-only mode. Delete folders you don't need. Perfect for the "my Python project needs structure" use case.

### Option 2: Git Subtree (For updates)
```bash
# In your existing project root
git subtree add --prefix=project-documents https://github.com/ecorkran/ai-project-guide.git main --squash
```

To update later:
```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=project-documents https://github.com/ecorkran/ai-project-guide.git main --squash
```

### Essential Files for Quick Structure
For immediate project organization, focus on:
- **`project-guides/guide.ai-project.process.md`** - The core 6-phase methodology
- **`project-guides/template.ai-project.prompts.md`** - Ready-made AI prompts  
- **`project-guides/coderules.md`** - Copy into your `.cursorrules` or equivalent

These three files will immediately give your AIs the structure and context they need to help effectively.

## ü§ù Contributing
* Keep documents concise; link out rather than duplicate content.  
* Cite sources inline when pulling in external material.  
* Follow the ‚Äúone-path rule‚Äù: each document should live in exactly one canonical folder.  
* For substantial restructures, update `directory-structure.md` first, then this README.

Thanks for helping maintain a knowledge base that humans and AI agents can navigate with zero friction!  Happy building.
