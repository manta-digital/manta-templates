## Code Review Process

### Overview
This document outlines the process for conducting code reviews in the Manta Trading MVP project. Code reviews ensure code quality, maintainability, and alignment with project goals while identifying potential issues before they become problematic.

### Code Review Questionnaire

When reviewing code, answer these core questions:

1. **Potential Bugs & Edge Cases**
   - Are there any bugs or strong potential for bugs?
   - Are there unhandled edge cases?
   - Are there race conditions or memory leaks?
   - Are subscriptions and event listeners properly cleaned up?

2. **Hard-coded Elements**
   - Is anything hard-coded that should be configurable?
   - Are there magic numbers or strings that should be constants or settings?
   - Are date ranges, timeouts, or numeric thresholds hard-coded?

3. **Artificial Constraints**
   - Are there assumptions that will limit future expansion?
   - Does the code artificially restrict functionality?
   - Are there fixed array sizes, limited input ranges, or hardcoded limits?

4. **Code Duplication & Reuse**
   - Is there repeated code that should be factored into functions?
   - Are there patterns that could be abstracted?
   - Could utility functions improve readability?

5. **Component Structure**
   - Are there monolithic pieces that should be split?
   - Does the component have a single responsibility?
   - Could the code benefit from being broken into smaller components?

6. **Design Patterns & Best Practices**
   - Are there opportunities to use better patterns?
   - Is the code following React/TypeScript best practices?
   - Could performance be improved with memoization or other techniques?
   - Is there proper error handling?

7. **Type Safety & Documentation**
   - Is the code properly typed?
   - Are there any `any` types that could be more specific?
   - Is the code well-documented with comments?
 
7. Platform: NextJS
   * cn should be used instead of string operations for parameterized className strings.
   * ensure no deprecated expressions are present

## Code Review Process

### Step 1: Create Review Document
Create a review document following the naming convention `review.{filename}.MMDD.md` in the `project-documents/our-project/code-reviews` directory.
##### YAML Block
This should be placed at the beginning of all created code-review files:
```yaml
---
layer: project
docType: review
---
```

### Step 2: Conduct Review
Analyze the file systematically using the code review questionnaire. Group findings by category for clarity.

### Step 3: Create Tasks from Review Findings
Transform review findings into actionable tasks in a separate file named `tasks.code-review.{filename}.MMDD.md` in the `project-documents/code-reviews` directory.

### Step 4: Task Processing
Process the task list according to Phase 3 and Phase 4 of the `guide.ai-project.process`:

1. **Phase 3: Granularity and Clarity**
   - Convert each review finding into clear, actionable tasks
   - Ensure task scope is precise and narrow
   - Include acceptance criteria

2. **Phase 4: Expansion and Detailing**
   - Add implementation details and subtasks
   - Reference specific code locations
   - Provide concrete examples where helpful

Example task structure:

```markdown
## Code Review Tasks: {Component}

- [ ] **Task 1: Remove Hard-coded Date Range**
  - Replace hard-coded 2024 date range with configurable values 
    from settings
  - Add to chartSettings.ts with appropriate defaults
  - Update initialization code to use these settings
  - **Success:** Chart date constraints are configurable without 
    code changes
```

### Step 5: Prioritization and Implementation

The Project Manager will prioritize tasks for implementation based on:
- Risk level (bugs first)
- Technical debt impact
- Development efficiency
- Feature roadmap alignment
