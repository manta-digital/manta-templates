Numerous optimizations were added to the React template specifically pre-compiling of all markdown content into HTML.  Components remain client-side without the extra load of processing and rendering the markdown on the client.


Bug reports are welcome; expect some rough edges as we stabilize toward v1.0.

## Documentation Still Needed:
* Theme structure
* Color customizations


## Guides Quickstart
Running `pnpm setup-guides` gets you the ai-project-guide in `project-documents/`.  Place any project-specific guides in a `private` subfolder.  Mimic structure of the parent folder (minus the `private` folder, lest you recurse infinitely).  Run `pnpm update-guides` to fetch any updates from ai-project-guide.  

### Organization Private Guides
You can also keep organization-wide private guides that you can easily use in multiple projects. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and set  `PRIVATE_GUIDES_URL=your-private-guides-repository`. Organization private guides will not overwrite project-specific guides.  *Disclaimer: this feature has not been thoroughly tested.*

### Guides Homepage
Guides repository is public and available at: https://github.com/ecorkran/ai-project-guide



## üîß Project Guides

This monorepo ships **public** guides under `project-documents/`. To copy them into *any* template's `project-documents/` folder, run in the template folder:

```bash
pnpm run setup-guides
```

If you maintain your own **private** guide repo, you can layer it on top:

```bash
pnpm run setup-guides:private
```

Under the hood:

* **`sync-guides`** (root) uses Git subtree to import or update `project-documents/` automatically (no manual remote setup).
* **`setup-guides`** (template) uses `rsync` to copy `project-documents/` ‚Üí `project-documents/`.
* **`setup-guides:private`** clones your private repo, rsyncs its `private/` folder, then re-runs `setup-guides`.

## üõ† Monorepo Development

### Template Development Workflow

When developing templates within the monorepo:

1. **Template development work** goes in `project-artifacts/{template}-template/` (not in the template itself)
2. **Templates ship clean** without `project-documents/` - users get guides via `setup-guides`
3. **setup-guides enables version control** for project-documents after population

### Why This Approach?

- **Clean distribution**: Templates ship without development artifacts
- **User flexibility**: Users get guides when they need them and can commit their customizations
- **No conflicts**: Template development work doesn't interfere with user experience

For template users, this complexity is hidden - they just run `setup-guides` and everything works.
